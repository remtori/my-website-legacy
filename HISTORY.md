## History

Time line: @vanilla > @preact > @preact-v2 > @react > @preact-v3

- At first i tried vanilla, but its only get so far

- Next is `preact`, because at the time i think `react` is really bloated for my site, i thinks most of these project i gave up when its come to `redux` intergation

- Then i tried again with preact and this time with some `typescript` and `rxjs`

- And then one more time with a full fledged `react` and `boostrap4`

- `@preact-v3` is the most recent, most serious attempt at "completing" this project
