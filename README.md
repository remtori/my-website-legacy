# REMTORI's website

This repo is my multiple attempt at making a personal website

## History

Time line: Vanilla > Preact > Preact-next > React > Elm

- At first i tried vanilla, but its only get so far

- Next is `preact`, because at the time i think `react` is really bloated for my site, i thinks most of these project i gave up when its come to `redux` intergation

- Then i tried again with preact and this time with some `rxjs`

- And then one more time with a full fledged `react` and `boostrap4`

- Now, i will check out `elm` and see how far its get me

## Specifications

- Cool Landing Page
- A functional Blog, with comments and stuff
- A project tabs where i show stuff i make for the web.
- Search Function
- A Gallery Collection
- `Service Worker` to make PWA
- Fancy loading animation with blank template, like `Facebook`, `Reddit` (named Skeleton animation)
