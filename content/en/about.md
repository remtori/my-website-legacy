# About me

I'm the guy who make this, pretty proud of myself for that tbh ~

## Personal Info

I am Lê Quang Vũ, an 90's kid, one of the last of them btw, an 99er.

At of the time writing this i studying Computer Science at University of Science at Hồ Chí Minh city.

I like games, anime and coding. In my honest opinion, i am not a creative person which is why i love its when i come up with something creative like the name "Remtori". Its a combination of the two anime characters i really love at the time, Rem (in Re: Zero) and Kotori (full name Kotori Minami in Love Live!)
