# Blog #2

Hey there, so this is the number 2, i write this immediately after the first one though.

Currently i'm writing these using VSCode with a newly added extension for spell-checking, if only there is another one for translation ... lets look for it shall we.

After a little bit of looking around nothing satisfy my use case, i known what i want to write, i just didn't remember a right word to use, so i just need a Google Translate like UI that i can enter word to translate from / to quickly. The usage for all the extension i has seen however are all for translate a paragraph to a certain language

Hey, when writing about a topic its seem like i can write a lots, cool ~
